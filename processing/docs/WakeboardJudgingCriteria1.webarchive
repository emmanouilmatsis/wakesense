<b></b><li><b>Exceptions to the Rules</b>: Where compliance with the rules is not feasible, the Chief Judge shall with the approval of the majority of the Judges, make the necessary changes. Such changes will be announced at a riders' or team captains' meeting, and by posting. The Chief Judge shall send a report to the WWC to explain these changes to the rules. Where the rules are definite and feasible, a vote of the Judges to decide whether to enforce any provision is prohibited.</li>
<b></b><li><b>Drug Testing</b>: All competitors must agree to be subject to doping control. Specific policies and procedures regarding doping control shall be detailed in the Medical Regulations of the International Water Ski Federation.</li>
<b></b><li><b>Unsportsmanlike Conduct</b>: Any rider (or his representative) or official whose conduct is deemed unsportsmanlike or whose conduct may cause discredit to the WWC or the IWSF, either on or off the competition site, before during, or after the competition, may be disqualified from all or part of the competition including completed events and/or be subject to a fine to be determined by the WWC, by a two-thirds majority vote of the Judges.

</font><b><font face="Arial"><p>5.	HEAT SYSTEM / RUNNING ORDER</p>
</font></b><font face="Arial"><ol><b>
</b><ol><b>

</b><li>Competitions will use a heat system.</li>
<li>In qualifying rounds, positions are determined by the competitor seeding, which is determined by last yearâ€™s Ranking List of their respective regional Tour. For those riders who have not competed in such events, their specific heat and running order will be randomly determined by computer. The number of riders in each heat is dependent on the total number of riders entered. A percentage of the riders from each heat will then go through to the, semi-finals and finals.</li>
<li>The Last Chance Qualification (LCQ) round may or may not be used within the competition, dependent on numbers.</li>
<li>If a rider fails to be on hand and ready to ride when the boat is prepared to start, the Dock Marshall may recommend his disqualification to the Chief Judge; however, the Dock Marshall may grant up to one additional minute of time for emergencies developing or discovered just prior to the rider's turn to ride (e.g. ripped binding).</li>
<li>In the case where a rider has been disqualified or has been scratched, a one-minute delay shall be granted to the next rider in the starting order if he was not on the starting dock at the time of disqualification. If more than one rider has been disqualified or has scratched, the time allotted to the next rider shall be one minute for each rider disqualified or scratched.</li></ol>

</ol>


<ul><dir>
<dir>


<ul>
<li>If additional length will bring riders into contact with solid or stationary objects,</li>
<li>If it would bring the rider into shallow water (less than 2 feet deep) within the competition area,</li>
<li>Be hazardous to spectators or themselves</li></ul>
</dir>
</dir>

</dir>
</dir>
</ul>

<ol>
<ol>

<b></b><li><b>Helmets</b>: Riders must wear a suitable helmet if they choose to hit any of the obstacles in the wakeboard course. If a rider hits an obstacle without a helmet, he will be disqualified from the competition.</li>
<b></b><li><b>Damaged Equipment</b>: A rider is fully responsible for his personal equipment. If a rider has damaged his equipment, he will have <b>three</b> minutes to repair the equipment. The Chief Judge will have the final say as to whether the equipment has failed. The damaged equipment can either be repaired on the back of the boat or at the dock. The time begins when the rider gets on the back of the boat or onto the dock. The rider must have both feet back in his bindings before the 3 minutes elapses or his routine is over.</li></ol>
</ol>

<b><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10.	FORMAT</p>
</b><ol><b>
</b><ol><b>

</b><li>Riders will be judged in a FREERIDE format only.</li>
<li>There will be a minimum of two rounds, a Qualification or Semifinal Round, and a Final Round.</li>
<li>A Last Chance Qualifier Round (LCQ) shall be run when practical, depending on number of riders. Decision to run LCQ shall be at the discretion of the Chief Judge.</li>
<li>One round will consist of two passes (circuits/laps) through the course, each pass consisting of combinations of inverts, grabs, rotational tricks, and obstacles. Riders may perform any tricks they choose in any order they wish.</li>
<li>Judging of the routine begins when the rider enters the course and ends when the rider exits the course, falls for a second time, or completes his Wild Card trick.</li>
<li>Wild Card tricks are allowed only in the Finals. A Wild Card trick may be performed only if the rider successfully completes his second pass without a fall. After completion of the second pass the rider must continue back into the course to attempt the trick. Wild Card tricks are scored subjectively (style points only).</li>
<li>Sliders, Kickers, or other obstacles may be used.</li>
<li>Speed is at the discretion of the rider but must be within the maximum and minimum tolerances allowed for the site. The speed must remain constant while the rider is in the course.</li></ol>
</ol>

<b><p>11.	JUDGING CRITERIA / SCORING</p>
</b><ol><b>
</b><ol><b>

</b><li>Judging will be SUBJECTIVE only. There will be no predetermined points for any tricks and no attack sheets.</li>
<li>Points in the form of â€˜style pointsâ€™ will be given and based on execution, intensity and composition.</li>
<li>The score awarded will reflect both passes; to arrive at a single combined score from 0-100.</li>
<li>A maximum of 100 points can be earned for both passes. Style points will be awarded at each judgeâ€™s discretion based on their impression of the entire routine. Every movement will be judged. Judges will score contestants in each of the following three categories:</li>
<b><p align="CENTER">Execution = 33.3 points</p>
</b><p align="CENTER">(Level of mastery of tricks performed)</p>
<p>The judgeâ€™s look for the level of technical perfection of the maneuvers preformed, as well as the successful completion of the entire run</p>
<b><p align="CENTER">Intensity = 33.4 points</p>
</b><p align="CENTER">(Level of trick, how big, moves taken to their limit)</p>
<p>How impressive was the routine, how big did the rider go? The judges will look for the degree of effort in each maneuver performed and of the overall run</p>
<b><p align="CENTER">Composition = 33.3 points</p>
</b><p align="CENTER">(Variation of tricks, overall look of the run, smooth transition between moves)</p>
<p>The level of variety and creativity displayed by the rider. Judges are looking for <b><i>variety</i></b> and <b><i>diversity</i></b> of tricks in a flowing creative sequence. In the Judgeâ€™s eyes, a better Rider is one who performs a good balance of Air Tricks, Sliders/Obstacles, Spins, Heel Side, Toe Side, Switch, etc.</p>
<li>Repetition of tricks in each round is NOT allowed, and will not be scored.</li>
<li>Any trick performed outside of the course or using the pull of a deflection pulley will NOT be scored.</li>
<li>Wakeskate will be scored <b>Dock Start</b> (10%), <b>Execution</b> (45%), and <b>Composition</b> (45%). One Dock Start fall is allowed, with no penalty. Wakeskaters will have the same 2 passes as wakeboarders, with their run ending on second fall. Repeating tricks is not allowed and will not be scored.</li>
<li>There must be a minimum of three judges, one of which will act as Chief Judge. All must be recognized by the WWC.</li>
<li>Judges must ensure equal riding conditions are applied to all competitors.</li></ol>
</ol>

<b><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>12.	PROTESTS</p>
</b><ol><b>
</b><ol><b>

</b><li>Protests shall be made to the Chief Judge only by a team representative. Protest must be made in writing, must state the reason(s) for the protest, and must be filed as soon as possible, but no later than <b>10 minutes</b> after the occurrence or after the results of the event are announced.</li>
<li>Protests shall be allowed only for failure of the judges and calculators to comply with these rules and only if this non-compliance with rules has an adverse effect on a rider.</li>
<li>A correction of an error in the computation of scores shall not be considered a protest and the correction shall be made on the approval of the Chief Judge and Calculator within 10 minutes after the results are announced, and Judges' scoring sheets have been made available for inspection. The inspection of scoring sheets will be done only in the presence of the Judges scoring that particular event.</li>
<li>Protests must be accompanied by the approximate equivalent in local currency of 50 US $. This amount will be refunded if the protest is considered reasonable or upheld by the Judges.</li>
<li>Due to the subjective scoring nature and spirit of wakeboarding, video footage of any kind will not be used by Judges, riders or team representatives to resolve any disputes. Judges can only use the video footage before scoring a riderâ€™s routine.</li></ol>
</ol>

<b><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>13.	SCHEDULE CHANGES</p>
</b><ol><b>
</b><ol><b>

</b><li>Changes in the schedule during the competition shall be made only for weather, water conditions, safety, or similar reason. Such changes will be announced at a riders' or team captains' meeting, and by posting.</li>
<li>The finals of each category must be completed to determine a winner, even if the Judges are obliged to continue it at a different site. If a final cannot be completed, all riders from the event will compete again where and when possible, until a winner is determined.</li></ol>
</ol>

<b><p>14.	PRIZES</p>
</b><ol><b>
</b><ol><b>

</b><li>Medals or trophies will be awarded to the top three competitors in each division.</li></ol>
